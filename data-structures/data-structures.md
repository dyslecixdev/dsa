# Array

- Used to store and manage collections multiple elements.
- Homogeneous: All the elements should be of the same data type.
- Ordered: Elements are stored and can be accessed in sequence.
- Fixed/Static can hold a maximum number of elements, and Dynamic can hold any number of elements (e.g. JavaScript, Python, and C#).

# Linked List

- Used to store and manage collections of dynamic elements.
- Dynamic: Can hold any number of elements.
- Efficient Insertions & Deletions: Can be performed without the element shifting that is needed for arrays.
- Inefficient Random Access: To get to a specific node you need to traverse every node in order, making it harder than accessing any element in an array.
- No Contiguous Memory: Each node is its own block of memory unlike elements in an array where the array is the block of memory.
